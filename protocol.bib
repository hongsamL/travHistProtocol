  abstract = "Phylogenetic methods can use the sampling times of molecular
              sequence data to calibrate the molecular clock, enabling the
              estimation of evolutionary rates and timescales for rapidly
              evolving pathogens and data sets containing ancient DNA samples.
              A key aspect of such calibrations is whether a sufficient amount
              of molecular evolution has occurred over the sampling time
              window, that is, whether the data can be treated as having come
              from a measurably evolving population. Here, we investigate the
              performance of a fully Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal
              (BETS) in sequence data. The method involves comparing the fit to
              the data of two models: a model in which the data are accompanied
              by the actual (heterochronous) sampling times, and a model in
              which the samples are constrained to be contemporaneous
              (isochronous). We conducted simulations under a wide range of
              conditions to demonstrate that BETS accurately classifies data
              sets according to whether they contain temporal signal or not,
              even when there is substantial among-lineage rate variation. We
              explore the behavior of this classification in analyses of five
              empirical data sets: modern samples of A/H1N1 influenza virus,
              the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, coronaviruses from mammalian
              hosts, ancient DNA from Hepatitis B virus, and mitochondrial
              genomes of dog species. Our results indicate that BETS is an
              effective alternative to other tests of temporal signal. In
              particular, this method has the key advantage of allowing a
              coherent assessment of the entire model, including the molecular
              clock and tree prior which are essential aspects of Bayesian
              phylodynamic analyses.",

              the nature of the threat and develop new medical countermeasures.
              Governments need the data to trace the extent of the outbreak,
              initiate public health responses, and coordinate access to
              medicines and vaccines. Recent outbreaks suggest, however, that
              the sharing of such data cannot be taken for granted - making the
              timely international exchange of virus data a vital global
              challenge. This article undertakes the first analysis of the
              Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data as an innovative
              policy effort to promote the international sharing of genetic and
              associated influenza virus data. Based on more than 20

              international community, coupled with analysis of a wide range of
              primary and secondary sources, the article finds that the Global
              Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data contributes to global
              health in at least five ways: (1) collating the most complete
              repository of high-quality influenza data in the world; (2)
              facilitating the rapid sharing of potentially pandemic virus
              information during recent outbreaks; (3) supporting the World
              Health Organization's biannual seasonal flu vaccine strain
              selection process; (4) developing informal mechanisms for
              conflict resolution around the sharing of virus data; and (5)

  abstract = "Motivation: The structured coalescent is widely applied to study
              demography within and migration between sub-populations from
              genetic sequence data. Current methods are either exact but too
              computationally inefficient to analyse large datasets with many
              sub-populations, or make strong approximations leading to severe
              biases in inference. We recently introduced an approximation
              based on weaker assumptions to the structured coalescent enabling
              the analysis of larger datasets with many different states. We
              showed that our approximation provides unbiased migration rate
              and population size estimates across a wide parameter range.
              Results: We extend this approach by providing a new algorithm to
              calculate the probability of the state of internal nodes that
              includes the information from the full phylogenetic tree. We show
              that this algorithm is able to increase the probability
              attributed to the true sub-population of a node. Furthermore we
              use improved integration techniques, such that our method is now
              able to analyse larger datasets, including a H3N2 dataset with
              433 sequences sampled from five different locations. Availability

              history of sampled lineages from genetic data. Applications of
              phylogeography are broad, and in the context of pathogens include
              the reconstruction of transmission histories and the origin and
              emergence of outbreaks. Phylogeographic inference based on
              bottom-up population genetics models is computationally
              expensive, and as a result faster alternatives based on the
              evolution of discrete traits have become popular. In this paper,
              we show that inference of migration rates and root locations
              based on discrete trait models is extremely unreliable and
              sensitive to biased sampling. To address this problem, we
              introduce BASTA (BAyesian STructured coalescent Approximation), a
              new approach implemented in BEAST2 that combines the accuracy of
              methods based on the structured coalescent with the computational
              efficiency required to handle more than just few populations. We
              illustrate the potentially severe implications of poor model
              choice for phylogeographic analyses by investigating the zoonotic
              transmission of Ebola virus. Whereas the structured coalescent
              analysis correctly infers that successive human Ebola outbreaks
              have been seeded by a large unsampled non-human reservoir
              population, the discrete trait analysis implausibly concludes
              that undetected human-to-human transmission has allowed the virus
              to persist over the past four decades. As genomics takes on an
              increasingly prominent role informing the control and prevention
              of infectious diseases, it will be vital that phylogeographic

              geographical distribution of viruses has been frequently
              interpreted in the light of their genetic histories.
              Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration
              patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free
              heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the
              temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of
              probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique
              opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we
              introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and
              hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing
              character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled
              phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral
              dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty.
              Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic
              search variable selection procedure that identifies the
              parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition,
              we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling
              distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the
              spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal
              information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe
              software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with
              previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza

              important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily

              spatial epidemiological models used to predict the behavior of
              influenza and other infectious diseases. Yet it remains difficult
              to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various
              geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone.
              Evolutionary analyses of pathogen genome sequences increasingly
              provide insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza viruses,
              but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information
              on human mobility, mainly because no statistical framework exists
              within which viral gene sequences and empirical data on host
              movement can be combined. Here, we address this problem by
              applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global
              spread of human influenza subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to
              predict the spatial spread of human influenza A viruses
              worldwide. Using a framework that estimates the migration history
              of human influenza while simultaneously testing and quantifying a
              range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread, we
              show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air
              passenger flows, whereas at more local scales spread is also
              determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance.
              Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China
              and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global
              influenza diversity. By comparing model output with the known
              pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009, we demonstrate that
              predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when
              data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated. In
              conclusion, the global dynamics of influenza viruses are best
              explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial
              information inherent in sampled viral genomes. The integrated

              detailed geographical and environmental observations. Such

              reconstructing phylogeographic history on a continuous landscape.
              Here, we present a Bayesian statistical approach to infer
              continuous phylogeographic diffusion using random walk models
              while simultaneously reconstructing the evolutionary history in

              Here we present BEAST: a fast, flexible software architecture for
              Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences related by an
              evolutionary tree. A large number of popular stochastic models of

              for both within- and between-species sequence data are
              implemented. RESULTS: BEAST version 1.4.6 consists of 81000 lines
              of Java source code, 779 classes and 81 packages. It provides
              models for DNA and protein sequence evolution, highly parametric

              long-term association between RNA viruses and their hosts. Based
              on the appearance of strong host specificity, it has been
              suggested that hantaviruses cospeciated with the rodents and
              insectivores they infect since these mammals last shared a common
              ancestor, approximately 100 million years ago. We tested this
              hypothesis of host-virus codivergence in two ways: 1) we used
              cophylogenetic reconciliation analysis to assess the fit of the
              virus tree onto that of the host and 2) we estimated the
              evolutionary rates and divergence times for the Hantavirus genus

              compared these with those of their hosts. Our reconciliation

              are the result of a more recent history of preferential host

              strong assumption and allowed for analytic integration of
              uncertainty for discrete virus phylogeography. We used automatic
              language processing methods to find and assign uncertainty to
              alternative potential locations. We considered two influenza case
              studies: H5N1 in Egypt; H1N1 pdm09 in North America. For each, we
              implemented scenarios in which 25 per cent of the taxa had
              different amounts of sampling uncertainty including 10, 30, and
              50 per cent uncertainty and varied how it was distributed for
              each taxon. This includes scenarios that: (i) placed a specific
              amount of uncertainty on one location while uniformly
              distributing the remaining amount across all other candidate
              locations (correspondingly labeled 10, 30, and 50); (ii) assigned
              the remaining uncertainty to just one other location; thus
              'splitting' the uncertainty among two locations (i.e. 10/90,
              30/70, and 50/50); and (iii) eliminated uncertainty via two
              predefined heuristic approaches: assignment to a centroid
              location (CNTR) or the largest population in the country (POP).
              We compared all scenarios to a reference standard (RS) in which
              all taxa had known (absolutely certain) locations. From this, we
              implemented five random selections of 25 per cent of the taxa and
              used these for specifying uncertainty. We performed posterior
              analyses for each scenario, including: (a) virus persistence, (b)
              migration rates, (c) trunk rewards, and (d) the posterior
              probability of the root state. The scenarios with sampling
              uncertainty were closer to the RS than CNTR and POP. For H5N1,
              the absolute error of virus persistence had a median range of
              0.005-0.047 for scenarios with sampling uncertainty-(i) and (ii)

              for the pdm09 case study followed a similar trend as did our
              analyses of migration rates across scenarios (i) and (ii). When
              considering the posterior probability of the root state, we found
              all but one of the H5N1 scenarios with sampling uncertainty had
              agreement with the RS on the origin of the outbreak whereas both
              CNTR and POP disagreed. Our results suggest that assigning
              geospatial uncertainty to taxa benefits estimation of virus
              phylogeography as compared to ad-hoc heuristics. We also found
              that, in general, there was limited difference in results
              regardless of how the sampling uncertainty was assigned; uniform
              distribution or split between two locations did not greatly
              impact posterior results. This framework is available in BEAST
              v.1.10. In future work, we will explore viruses beyond influenza.
              We will also develop a web interface for researchers to use our
              language processing methods to find and assign uncertainty to
              alternative potential locations for virus phylogeography.",

  abstract = "BEAGLE is a high-performance likelihood-calculation library for
              phylogenetic inference. The BEAGLE library defines a simple, but
              flexible, application programming interface (API), and includes a
              collection of efficient implementations for calculation under a
              variety of evolutionary models on different hardware devices. The
              library has been integrated into recent versions of popular
              phylogenetics software packages including BEAST and MrBayes, and
              has been widely used across a diverse range of evolutionary
              studies. Here we present BEAGLE 3, with new parallel
              implementations, increased performance for challenging data sets,
              improved scalability, and better usability. We have added new
              openCL and CPU (central processing unit)-threaded implementations
              to the library, allowing the effective utilization of a wider
              range of modern hardware. Further, we have extended the API and
              library to support concurrent computation of independent partial
              likelihood arrays, for increased performance of nucleotide-model
              analyses with greater flexibility of data partitioning. For
              better scalability and usability, we have improved how
              phylogenetic software packages use BEAGLE in multi-GPU (graphics
              processing unit) and cluster environments, and introduced an
              automated method to select the fastest device given the data set,
              evolutionary model, and hardware. For application developers who
              wish to integrate the library, we also have developed an online
              tutorial. To evaluate the effect of the improvements, we ran a
              variety of benchmarks on state-of-the-art hardware. For a
              partitioned exemplar analysis, we observe run-time performance
              improvements as high as 5.9-fold over our previous GPU
              implementation. BEAGLE 3 is free, open-source software licensed

  abstract = "Reconstructing pathogen dynamics from genetic data as they become
              available during an outbreak or epidemic represents an important
              statistical scenario in which observations arrive sequentially in
              time and one is interested in performing inference in an
              ``online'' fashion. Widely used Bayesian phylogenetic inference
              packages are not set up for this purpose, generally requiring one
              to recompute trees and evolutionary model parameters de novo when
              new data arrive. To accommodate increasing data flow in a
              Bayesian phylogenetic framework, we introduce a methodology to
              efficiently update the posterior distribution with newly
              available genetic data. Our procedure is implemented in the BEAST
              1.10 software package, and relies on a distance-based measure to
              insert new taxa into the current estimate of the phylogeny and
              imputes plausible values for new model parameters to accommodate
              growing dimensionality. This augmentation creates informed
              starting values and re-uses optimally tuned transition kernels
              for posterior exploration of growing data sets, reducing the time
              necessary to converge to target posterior distributions. We apply
              our framework to data from the recent West African Ebola virus
              epidemic and demonstrate a considerable reduction in time
              required to obtain posterior estimates at different time points
              of the outbreak. Beyond epidemic monitoring, this framework
              easily finds other applications within the phylogenetics
              community, where changes in the data-in terms of alignment
              changes, sequence addition or removal-present common scenarios
              that can benefit from online inference.",

              Skygrid model, a non-parametric coalescent model that estimates
              the effective population size over time. Available in BEAST, a

              is often estimated in conjunction with a molecular clock model to

              practical guide to using BEAST and its accompanying applications
              for the purpose of drawing inference under these models. We focus
